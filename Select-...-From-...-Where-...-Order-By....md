*Relational model versus Semantic arrays [[DML]]*

The *Select ... From ... Where ... Order By* statement is used to select one or more [[attributes|attribute]] from a table with a [Where Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_(SQL)) (selection criterium) and an [Order By](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_by) Clause (sort criterium).

In GeoDMS configure this type of Statements in two steps:

1. First configure the [[Select ... From ... Where ...]] part of the statement.
2. For the resulting selection configure the [[Select ... From ... Order By...]] part.
