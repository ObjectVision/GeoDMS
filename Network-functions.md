Network [[functions|Operators and functions]] are used to build and calculate with [network topologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology) like [[connect]] or [[impedance|Impedance-functions]]

- [[first_node]] - *a point data item with the coordinates of the first point of an arc or polygon*
- [[last_node]]  - *a point data item with the coordinates of the last point of an arc or polygon*

<!-- -->

- [[connect]] - *creates the nearest point on an arc/polygon data item from a point data item or finds the nearest point in a point data item from another point data item*
- [[connect_eq]] - *creates the nearest point on an arc/polygon data item from a point data item if the values of two data items match*
- [[connect_ne]] - *creates the nearest point on an arc/polygon data item from a point data item if the values of two data items do not match*
- [[connect_neighbour]] - *a relation to the nearest point in the same point data item, not being the point itself*
- [[connect_info]] - *information for each point on the connection to an arc/polygon data item, as made by the connect function*
- [[connect_info_eq]] - *information for each point on the connection to an arc/polygon data item, as made by the connect_eq function*
- [[connect_info_ne]] - *information for each point on the connection to an arc/polygon data item, as made by the connect_ne function*
- [[connected_parts]] - *the connected (sub)networks that exist in a set of links*
- [[capacitated_connect]] - *finds the nearest point in a point data item from another point data item with a capacity constraint*
