We welcome (regular) users of the GeoDMS to help us improving the software. Bug reports and feature requests can be reported to [here](https://github.com/ObjectVision/GeoDMS/issues). Contact us if you are interested.

## reporting issues

Before reporting an issue we ask you to check if the same or a similar issue is not already reported. New bugs and feature requests can be
added by activating the *New Issue* button. A page appears in which the characteristics of the issue need to be specified. The
characteristics presented with a \* are obligatory. 

## getting remote support

If your organisation has a support contract, we can help you with configuration issues. 
We can assist you from our office by phone and a remote connection with e.g. Teams.
