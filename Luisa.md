== introduction == The EUClueScanner, based on the [Land Use
Scanner](Ruimtescanner "wikilink") and the
[Clue](http://www.ivm.vu.nl/en/Organisation/departments/spatial-analysis-decision-support/Clue/index.aspx)
model, is a framework for [Land Use
Modelling](Land_Use_Modelling "wikilink") at a European scale.

It is available as part of the Land-Use-based Integrated Sustainability
Assessment Modelling ([LUISA](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/luisa)),
formerly known as Land Use Modeling Plantform (LUMP).

## characteristics

-   European scale: 100 meter grid level (approximately 2.700.000.000
    cells) or 1000 meter grid level (approximately 24.000.000 cells)
-   [Land Use Types](Land_Use_Types "wikilink") for urban, nature,
    argicultural and water
-   Claims at nuts2 or aggregated levels, resulting from other models
    (Leitap, Image).
-   LandUse, Environmental and Socio Economic indicators

## allocation

The [discrete allocation](Discrete_Allocation "wikilink") method is
used to generate an allocation with maximum total suitability within the
constraints of the regional [land use](Land_Use "wikilink") claims.

The method is applied in small time steps of one year, taking into
account both static and dynamic factors in order to model (long term)
investments and natural succession processes.

## partners

The EUClueScanner has been developedÂ  in two projects, commissioned by:

-   [DG Environment of the European
    Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/index_en)
-   [JRC-IES](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/about/jrc-site/ispra) in Ispra
