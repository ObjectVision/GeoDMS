*[[Configuration examples]] Grid processing*

This script explores different [[grid]] processing operations using a case study where for a set of buildings the height is
determined from a [height grid data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_elevation_model) (AHN).

Furthermore the grid distance to those buildings is calculated. The study area in this example is the historic center of the city of Hulst
in the Netherlands.
