*[[Recent Developments]]: Group by in Table*

A first implementation of the Group by functionality is introduced in version 7.175. This makes it possible to aggregate/group by data directly in the table. The Group by tool can be applied on one or multiple columns, by selecting these columns in the table and activating the tool. The Group by columns are coloured in a palette from green to grey. Other columns are aggregated with a default aggregation type. With  the Aggregate By pop up menu option another aggregation type can be chosen.
