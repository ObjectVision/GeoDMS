The [GeoDMS GUI] can run in two modes:

- **User Mode**: a mode for the less experienced user, presenting on the items for which the IsHidden [[property]] is not configured to *True*. The idea is that the modeler can configure which [[tree items|tree item]] are less relevant for the user, making the configuration less complex.
- **Administrator mode**: a mode for the (more) experienced user, presenting always all items.
