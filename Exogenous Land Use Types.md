Exogenous [land use types](Land_Use_Types "wikilink") are types of
[land use](Land_Use "wikilink") that are not allocated by the an
[allocation model](Allocation "wikilink") in contrast to [Endogenous
Land Use Types](Endogenous_Land_Use_Types "wikilink").

Examples are:

1.  nearly immutable types of [land use](Land_Use "wikilink") such as
    water and glaciers
2.  highly connected and planned types of [land
    use](Land_Use "wikilink") such as transport infrastructure
