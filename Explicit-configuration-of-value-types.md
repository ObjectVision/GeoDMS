The GeoDMS offers [[operators and functions]] with efficient algorithms for fast calculations of (large) data sets.

A necessary precondition for these algorithms is the awareness of the type of data of each data item.

In the GeoDMS this is called the [[value type]]. Value types are configured for each data item as part of the [[values unit]].
