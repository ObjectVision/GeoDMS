## project goal

To enable Vesta to be used in the Mondaine Suite. Part of the larger
MONDAINE project, wherein we use ESDL as the language to make different
energy models talk to each other.

The required interfaces/ coupling, required for the MONDAINE use cases
are:

-   Read [Vesta](Vesta "wikilink") input from ESDL, more specifically:
    Heat Sources, New Buildings, and Area Measures.
-   Translate [Vesta](Vesta "wikilink") Leidraad output into ESDL,
    using a python module.

## working with Vesta in the MONDAINE Suite

Within the MONDAINE project we have edited the Vesta model to used
within the MONDAINE suite. This means that it can be used for several
use cases and has output that can be converted into the ESDL-language
and then be used in other energy transition models.

How that works is described on the following pages:

    Vesta](Vesta_download_Mondaine "wikilink")
