Welcome to the **documentation** of the GeoDMS. <BR>Use the sidebar (at the right) to navigate to the relevant sections of the documentation.

The GeoDMS is a software framework for (spatial) modelling, used for:

- [Land Use modelling](https://github.com/ObjectVision/LandUseModelling/wiki)
- [Accessibility modelling](https://github.com/ObjectVision/AccessibilityModelling/wiki)
- [Energy modelling](https://www.pbl.nl/modellen/vesta)
- [Visualisation and projection of target groups](https://woonzorgwijzer.nl)

## features

The GeoDMS has added value in:

- Fast calculations and calculations with large datasets ([grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_(spatial_index)), [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector#In_Cartesian_space) and [[attribute]] data)
- [Scenario analyses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario_analysis), comparisons between multiple alternatives
- Modelling with (geographic data): [scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language), [repeatability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeatability), transparency and quality control
- Discrete allocation under capacity restrictions, [accessibility](https://github.com/ObjectVision/AccessibilityModelling/wiki) and network assignments
- High resolution mapping
