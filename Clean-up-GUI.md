*[[Recent Developments]]: Clean up GUI*

The [[GUI|GeoDMS GUI]] was developed with the idea that it is useful and possible to edit configurations (add/remove/edit items) with the GUI.

The current way of working is that configurations are edited with a [[Configuration File Editor]] and the GUI is used as a viewer on data, metadata
and calculations results.

Therefore menu options like Insert container/data item etc. are not longer in use and removed from the GUI. This is an ongoing process.
