Numeric data can be categorised as:

- [[Numerical]]: values describing quantities/measurements
- [[Categorical]]: values describing characteristics or groups


This distinction is important in interpreting your values. It effects:

- which [[operators/functions|Operators and functions]] can be applied logically on your data items.
- the [[Value Type]] to be configured the way data is classified (mainly for the map view).
