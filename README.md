# GeoDMS
Geographic Data & Model Software (GeoDMS) is a platform for developing Geographic Planning Support Systems.
Where fast generic, landuse modeling and routing algorithms are implemented in C++ and exposed through the GeoDMS scripting language.

# Getting started
If you are new to GeoDMS, the [GeoDMS academy](https://github.com/ObjectVision/GeoDMS_Academy) will guide you through some of the basic features of the language. 
Recent GeoDMS versions can be downloaded from the [release page](https://github.com/ObjectVision/GeoDMS/releases) of this repository. 
For the full documentation of GeoDMS, including additional examples, see [our wiki](https://github.com/ObjectVision/GeoDMS/wiki) or [geodms website](https://geodms.nl)

# Compilation
Build instructions for GeoDMS can be found at our [wiki compilation page](https://github.com/ObjectVision/GeoDMS/wiki/Compiling-the-GeoDMS) or our [web-site](https://geodms.nl/docs/compiling-the-geodms.html).
For a technical overview of the GeoDMS software, see readme-dms.MD in the GeoDMS source code root folder, or [here](https://github.com/ObjectVision/GeoDMS/blob/v14/readme-dms.MD)
