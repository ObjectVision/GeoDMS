Grid [[operators and functions]] functions are used to calculate with [[data items|data item]] of [[grid (two-dimensional) domains|Grid Domain]], explicitly using the two-dimensional structure of data in [[grid|grid]], like [[potential]] or [[district]].

-   [[dist2]] - *the distances in a grid towards a point data item*
-   [[griddist]] - *impedance in a grid towards the nearest point in a pointset, summing the resistances of the shortest path to the nearest point*

<!-- -->

-   [[potential]] - *a neighborhood operation to sum the values of neighbouring cells in a grid, based on a kernel*
-   [[proximity]] - *a neighborhood operation to get the maximum value of neighbouring cells in a grid, based on a kernel*
-   [[diversity]] - *the number of different occurences in the neighbourhood of each cell in a grid*

<!-- -->

-   [[district]]   - *adjacent (horizontal & vertical, not diagonal) grid cell values with the same values*
-   [[district_8]] - *adjacent (horizontal & vertical & diagonal) grid cell values with the same values*

<!-- -->

-   [[raster_merge]] - *to merge data from smaller to larger grids, e.g. to combine country grids to a European grid*
