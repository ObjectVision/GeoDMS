## definition

Composite functions are functions generating one or more subitems (e.g. [[select_with_org_rel]], [[GridDist]])

## caching

The direct results (generated [[subitems|subitem]]) are [[session-specific]].

Indirect results, calculated with expressions that are not only direct references to such subitems can be stored persistently.

In this way they differ from the session-specific functions.
