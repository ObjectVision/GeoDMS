*[[Selection functions]] select_with_org_rel*

## syntax

- select_with_org_rel(*condition*)
- select_uint8_with_org_rel(*condition*)
- select_uint16_with_org_rel(*condition*)
- select_uint32_with_org_rel(*condition*)
- select_uint64_with_org_rel(*condition*)

## definition

select_with_org_rel(*condition*) results in a new [[domain unit]] with a [[relation]] to the entries of the domain unit of the condition, for which the values of the *condition* [[argument]] are true.

The resulting [[value type]] of the domain unit is derived from the domain unit of the *condition* argument:

- uint32 for conditions with uint32, boolean, spoint or wpoint value type
- uint8 for conditions with uint8 value type
- uint16 for conditions with uint16 value type
- uint64 for conditions with uint64, ipoint or upoint value type

Between versions 8.44 and 8.7.2 the name [[select_orgrel]] was used for the select_with_org_rel function. 

The explicit *select_uint8_with_org_rel*, *select_uint16_with_org_rel*, *select_uint32_with_org_rel* and *select_uint64_with_org_rel* functions can be used in the same manner as the select_with_org_rel function, to create a new domain unit with the explicit value type.

## description

The select_with_org_rel function generates a [[subitem]], named *org_rel*. This [[data item]] contains the relation towards the domain unit of the *condition*  argument.

The select_with_org_rel and [[subset]] functions are similar, the only difference is that the subitem generated by the subset operator is called: <I>Nr_OrgEntity</I>, a name that does not meet with our [[naming conventions]].    

The *org_rel* data item can be used in a [[lookup]] function to relate [[attributes|attribute]] to the new domain unit, see the example.

See this [[overview | selection operator comparison]] for when to choose which selection operator is feasable.

## applies to

- *condition* must be a boolean attribute or [[subexpression]] resulting in boolean values.

## since version

8.8.0

}
