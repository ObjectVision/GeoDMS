*[[Recent Developments]]: Multi Tasking (also known as Parallel Processing, PP1/PP2)*

Multiple improvements, including solving potential dead-locks, have been made to the [Multi Tasking](wikipedia:Multithreading_(computer_architecture) "wikilink")(MT2) functionality. This allows the GeoDMS to perform multiple calculation steps simultaneously.

Since version 7.174 we advice to enable all Multi Tasking options (default setting since 7.196 when installing the GeoDMS.
 
If your local machine encounters memory issues or non reproducible errors, try to disable the MT2 option.

The option can be set from the Tools > Options > Advanced dialog (it is possible to overrule the default setting with a batch parameter).
