## introduction

Vesta is a spatially explicit model that matches future projected demand
for energy in **the built environment** to options for local & zonal
energy supply.

The primary focus for building this model was to assess impacts of
different policies for local and regional energy production on
non-renewable resource consumption, wealth (re)distribution, CO2
emission, compliance and public finance at the national level.

The demand for energy is modelled geographically specific for:
residential objects, business locations and greenhouses. Changes in the
built environment are taken into account by using the results of the
[Land Use Scanner.](Ruimtescanner "wikilink")

Not included are: industrial usage and roofless agriculture.

## data

Vesta uses only open data.The [BAG](BAG "wikilink") (Basisregister
Adressen en Gebouwen) is used to calculate the energy usage for each
residential and business building.

## downloads

Different versions of the model can be downloaded from the [VestaDV
github](https://github.com/RuudvandenWijngaart/VestaDV):

## applications

The model is used for the: [Startanalyse van de
Leidraad](https://expertisecentrumwarmte.nl/themas/de+leidraad/default.aspx),
to calculate at the neighbourhood level the results of alternative
strategies.
