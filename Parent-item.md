The GeoDMS uses a hierachical structure for [[naming|tree item name]] [[tree items|tree item]] in a configuration.

The parent item of an item A is the item one level higher, of which item A is a [[subitem]]. The parent items of the parent item of A are the indirect parent items of A.

The root item in a configuration has no parent item.

a point (.) in the configuration refers to the direct parent item, two points (..) to the parent of the parent etc.
