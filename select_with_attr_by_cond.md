*[[Selection functions]] select_with_attr_by_cond*

## syntax

- select_with_attr_by_cond(*src_tree_item*, *condition*)
- select_uint8_with_attr_by_cond(*src_tree_item*, *condition*)
- select_uint16_with_attr_by_cond(*src_tree_item*, *condition*)
- select_uint32_with_attr_by_cond(*src_tree_item*, *condition*)
- select_uint64_with_attr_by_cond(*src_tree_item*, *condition*)
## definition

select_with_attr_by_cond(*src_tree_item*, *condition*) results in a **new [[domain unit]]** for which the values of the *condition* [[argument]] are true. **Additionally, all [[subitems|subitem]] from the *src_tree_item* argument with the same domain unit as the *condition* become subitems of the resulting select_with_attr_by_cond [[unit]]** and with this resulting unit as new domain unit.

The resulting [[value type]] of the domain unit is derived from the domain unit of the *condition* argument:
- uint32 for conditions with uint32, boolean, spoint or wpoint [[value type]]
- uint8 for conditions with uint8 value type
- uint16 for conditions with uint16 value type
- uint64 for conditions with uint64, ipoint or upoint value type

The explicit *select_uint8_with_attr_by_cond*, *select_uint16_with_attr_by_cond*, *select_uint32_with_attr_by_cond* and *select_uint64_with_attr_by_cond* functions can be used in the same manner as the select_with_attr_by_cond function, to create a new domain unit with the explicit value type.

Between versions 8.6.0 and 8.7.2 the name [[select_many]] was used for the select_with_attr_by_cond function. 

## description

The select_with_attr_by_cond function does <B>not</B> generate a relation to the original domain, as the [[select_with_attr_by_org_rel]] function does.

The select_with_attr_by_cond function is efficient for larger selections, think about selection with 3% or more of the entries of the original domain. For smaller selections, the [[select_with_attr_by_org_rel]] function is advised.

The [[select_data]] function can be used in to relate [[attributes|attribute]] to the new domain unit.

See this [[overview | selection operator comparison]] for when to choose which selection operator is feasable.

If you want to also collect attributes from a container with the same domain unit of the condition. You can use the [[collect_attr_by_org_rel]].

## applies to

- *condition* must be a boolean attribute or [[subexpression]] resulting in boolean values.

## since version

8.8.0

## example

<pre>
unit&lt;uint32&gt; City: StorageName = "city.csv", StorageType = "gdal.vect", StoragReadOnly = "True"
{
   attribute&lt;string&gt; name
   attribute&lt;uint32&gt; RegionCode;
}

unit&lt;uint32&gt; ZHCities := <B>select_with_attr_by_cond(</B>City, City/RegionCode == 200<B>)</B>
</pre>

| City/RegionCode | City/Name |
|----------------:|-----------|
| 100             | Amsterdam |
| 200             | Rotterdam |
| 300             | Utrecht   |
| 200             | Den Haag  |
| 400             | Eindhoven |
| null            | Haarlem   |
| 400             | Tilburg   |

*domain City, nr of rows = 7*

|ZHCities/name|ZHCities/regionCode|
|-------------|------------------:|
|**Rotterdam**|**200**            |
|**Den Haag** |**200**            |

*domain <B>ZHCities</B>, nr of rows = 2*

<I> The subitems: name, regionCode are generated by the configured select_with_attr_by_cond function.</I>
