The current transition to renewable/sustainable energy has impact on
many aspects of our society.

Many different options are available to reduce carbon dioxide. These
options have different benefits and costs. Modelling can support in
choosing optimal alternatives.

## the built environment

Together with [PBL](https://www.pbl.nl) we develop the [Vesta
Model](Vesta_Model "wikilink"), a spatially explicit model that matches
future projected demand for energy in the built environment to options
for local and zonal energy supply.

This model is, amongst other, used for the
[Startanalyse](https://expertisecentrumwarmte.nl/themas/de+leidraad/default.aspx)
to support all municipalities in the Netherlands with their transition
strategy.
