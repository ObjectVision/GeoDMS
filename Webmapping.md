The GeoDMS is used to calculate information products.

To make these products available for a larger audience, we use Webmapping products, mainly in the [[Social Domain]].

## MapGallery

We do not develop Webmapping products ourselves, but work together with [Baasgeo.com](https://www.baasgeo.com/), developer of the [MapGallery](https://www.baasgeo.com).

MapGallery is a powerful and intuitive WebGIS solution, supporting monitoring and projections by using animations.  

We believe open Webmapping applications are useful tools in many policy areas, as sharing information is a key success factor in effective cooperation.

## examples

1\)     On [demo.wzwkaart.nl](https://demo.wzwkaart.nl) you can find examples of information products made with the GeoDMS and presented with MapGallery

2\)     The [WoonZorgwijzer](https://www.woonzorgwijzer.nl) uses MapGallery as viewer. The [WoonZorgwijzer](https://www.woonzorgwijzer.nl) portal presents also plus applications of the WoonZorgwijzer with additional layers on demography/real estate/service distribution and care consumption.
