The SourceDataDir is the root folder for source files/databases used in your project. The data in this folder (and subfolders) is usually read-only.

You can adjust the path on your local machine for the SourceDataDir from the [[GUI|GeoDMS GUI]] with the menu option: Tools > Options > Advanced Tab.

In your configuration you can use the [[placeholder|Folders and Placeholders]] %SourceDataDir% to refer to this folder.
