The contents of this dialog is dependent on the opened configuration. All string [[parameters|parameter]] configured in the container _ConfigSettings_ > _Overridable_ are presented in this view. Each parameter can be overruled with this dialog to set a local machine specific value, which is stored in the Windows Registry of the local machine.

This way, the generic configured folders can be configured to the folders as they occur on your computer.
