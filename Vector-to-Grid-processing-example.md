*[[Configuration examples]] Vector to Grid processing*

This script explores different options for making [[grid]] versions of [[vector data]]. The following examples are part of this script

1. Configuring grids for different grid sizes.
2. Configuring a grid at a small sizes and aggregate this to a larger cells is included. This can be used to make a grid based on maximum area (see also <https://www.geodms.nl/mantis/view.php?id=58>)
3. Configuring an [[arc]] data source, making a grid version of these arcs and combine these with a landuse grid.
