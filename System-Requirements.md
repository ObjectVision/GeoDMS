Many GeoDMS projects calculate with large datasets. This often requires additional requirements in terms of internal memory and/or harddisk space.

See for the additional requirements the project documentation.

2.  external storage:
    -   GeoDMS Program Files: 70 Mb
    -   Project data: project specific
    -   Local (for calculation results): project specific
3.  screen: High resolution with supporting video card (dual-screen recommended)

## software

-   [Windows Operating System](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows), version 10 or later.
