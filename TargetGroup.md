## introduction

In many policy areas the awareness increases that effective policy
depends on the characteristics of the people in an area.

Therefore knowledge on the demographics, socio-economic etc. of a
population in an neighborhood is important.

Using administrative areas has some disadvantages.

Therefore we implemented within the [GeoDMS](GeoDMS "wikilink")
technics to present a [clear and spatially explict
view](Patronen_van_groepen "wikilink") on the distribution of
population characteristics, in which data can never be related to
individual persons.

An example in which we use this approach is for instance the
[WoonZorgwijzer](http://www.woonzorgwijzer.info).
