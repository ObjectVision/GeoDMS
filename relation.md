A relation or relational attribute is an [[attribute]] containing as values the [ordinal number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number) of the elements of another domain. It thereby defines a mapping from each element of the domain for which it is an attribute to that other [[domain unit]]. The following picture illustrates this:

[[images/Relation_small.gif]]

A relation has the source domain as domain unit and the related/target domain as [[values unit]]. It's a mapping from the source towards the elated/target domain.

Synonyms in use for relation: [[partitioning]], [[index attribute]], relational attribute;

## naming convention

It is advised to use the postfix _rel when naming index attributes, see also [[naming conventions]].

## how to make

Relations are often made with a [[rlookup]] or [[point_in_polygon]] function. See also [[relational attribute example]].

## use

Relations are often used in [[relational functions]] and [[aggregation functions]].
