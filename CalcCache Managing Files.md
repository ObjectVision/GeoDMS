*[CalcCache](CalcCache "wikilink") Managing Files*

## introduction

The [CalcCache](CalcCache "wikilink") stores (intermediate results) of
your project, also of [expressions](expression "wikilink") that do not
occur anymore in your current configuration. The
[CalcCache](CalcCache "wikilink") therefore has a tendency to grow,
especially when multiple modifications are made to your configuration
and the results of these modified items are requested at least once.To
keep the size of your [CalcCache](CalcCache "wikilink") limited (as an
indicator if a [CalcCache](CalcCache "wikilink") becomes larger than 10
GB, disk I/O becomes slow), we advice to:

1.  [Compress Files](Compress_Files "wikilink")
2.  [Delete CalcCaches that are not recently
    used](Delete_CalcCaches_that_are_not_recently_used "wikilink")
3.  [Use FreeData property to keep your CalcCache size
    limited](Use_FreeData_property_to_keep_your_CalcCache_size_limited "wikilink")
4.  [Use mutiple CalcCaches within a
    project](Use_mutiple_CalcCaches_within_a_project "wikilink")
