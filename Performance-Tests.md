*[[Recent Developments]]: Performance Tests*


Each GeoDMS version published on our website passed our regression test, testing the operators (both in tiled/untiled variants) and the storage managers on small datasets.

-   Since version 7.168 performance tests are added showing how the GeoDMS behaves on large data sets/calculation processes.
-   Since version 7.229 a CalcCache test is added to test if results stored are stored in the CalcCache and are re-used.
-   Since version 7.234 tests are added on actions performed in the [[GUI|GeoDMS GUI]].

For specific projects tests are and can be added, informing the user for a test item:

-   whether the GeoDMS version results in the same output,
-   the duration to calculate this item.
