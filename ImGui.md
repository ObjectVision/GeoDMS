In 2022 we started the development of a new [[GeoDMS GUI]].

This new GUI is not longer developed in Delphi, but like the [[GeoDMS Engine]] in C++, using the dear [ImGui](https://www.dearimgui.org) GUI library.

Somes issues related to Delphi (like the flickering views) were difficult to solve, the ImGui library offers many interesting functions for improving the current GUI.  

## alpha version

Together with GeoDMS version 8.7.0 an Alpha version of this new GUI became available, see: https://github.com/ObjectVision/GeoDMS/releases/tag/v8.7.0

From 8.7.0 each GeoDMS release also contains a new version of this ImGui, with new functions and improvements.

## beta version

For the development of the beta version, see the project: https://github.com/orgs/ObjectVision/projects/4
